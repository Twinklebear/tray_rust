//! # tray\_rust - A Toy Ray Tracer in Rust
//! 
//! tray\_rust is a toy physically based ray tracer built off of the techniques
//! discussed in [Physically Based Rendering](http://pbrt.org/). It began life as a port of
//! [tray](https://github.com/Twinklebear/tray) to [Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org) to check out the language.
//! The renderer is currently capable of path tracing, supports triangle meshes (MTL support coming soon),
//! and various physically based material models (including measured data from the
//! [MERL BRDF Database](http://www.merl.com/brdf/)). tray\_rust also supports rigid body animation along
//! B-spline paths and distributed rendering.
//! 
//! [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Twinklebear/tray_rust.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Twinklebear/tray_rust)
//! 
//! ## Running
//!
//! Running and passing `--help` or `-h` will print out options you can pass to the renderer which are documented in the help.
//! For the more complicated use cases I hope to do some write ups and guides on how to use them (e.g. distributed rendering,
//! animation) but this may take a while. I strongly recommend running the release build as the debug version will be very slow.
//! 
//! ## Building Your Own Scenes
//! 
//! To position and animate objects, the camera and so on the
//! [Blender plugin](https://github.com/Twinklebear/tray_rust_blender) is the easiest to use. However the plugin
//! is still in development and missing some features like setting materials, changing light properties and such so
//! you'll still currently need to do those by hand in the exported JSON file. For materials take a look at
//! the [materials documentation](http://www.willusher.io/tray_rust/tray_rust/material/index.html) for lights
//! you'll likely just want to change the emission color which is an RGB color plus a strength term.
//!
//! Start at the documentation for the [scene module](http://www.willusher.io/tray_rust/tray_rust/scene/index.html),
//! there are also a few example [scenes](https://github.com/Twinklebear/tray_rust/tree/master/scenes) included but not all
//! the models are provided. From a clean `git clone` you should be able to run
//! [cornell\_box.json](https://github.com/Twinklebear/tray_rust/blob/master/scenes/cornell_box.json) and
//! [smallpt.json](https://github.com/Twinklebear/tray_rust/blob/master/scenes/smallpt.json). I plan to add some
//! more simple scenes that show usage of other features like animation to provide examples. The rigid body animation
//! feature is relatively new though so I haven't had time to document it properly yet.
//! 
//! ## TODO
//!
//! - More material models (eg. more microfacet models, rough glass, etc.)
//! - Textures
//! - Support for using an OBJ's associated MTL files
//! - Bump mapping
//! - [Subsurface scattering?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsurface_scattering)
//! - [Vertex Connection and Merging?](http://iliyan.com/publications/VertexMerging)
//! 
//! ## Sample Renders
//!
//! In the samples the the Buddha, Dragon, Bunny and Lucy statue are from
//! [The Stanford Scanning Repository](http://graphics.stanford.edu/data/3Dscanrep/).
//! The Rust logo model was made by
//! [Nylithius on BlenderArtists](http://blenderartists.org/forum/showthread.php?362836-Rust-language-3D-logo).
//! The Utah teapot used is from [Morgan McGuire's page](http://graphics.cs.williams.edu/data/meshes.xml) and
//! the monkey head is Blender's Suzanne. I've made minor tweaks to some of the models so for convenience
//! you can find versions that can be easily loaded into the sample scenes [here](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B-l_lLEMo1YeflUzUndCd01hOHhRNUhrQUowM3hVd2pCc3JrSXRiS3FQSzRYLWtGcGM0eGc&usp=sharing), though the
//! cube model for the Cornell box scene is included.
//! The materials on the Rust logo, Buddha, Dragon and Lucy are from the
//! [MERL BRDF Database](http://www.merl.com/brdf/).
//!
//! Render times are formatted as hh:mm:ss and were measured using 144 threads on a machine with four
//! [Xeon E7-8890 v3](http://ark.intel.com/products/84685/Intel-Xeon-Processor-E7-8890-v3-45M-Cache-2_50-GHz)
//! CPUs. The machine is an early/engineering sample from Intel so your results may differ, but massive thanks to
//! Intel for the hardware! Some older renders are shown as well without timing since they were
//! run on a different machine.
//!
//! Some more sample renders can be found [here](http://imgur.com/a/3qNBc).
